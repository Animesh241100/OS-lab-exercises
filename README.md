# OS Lab Assignment Solutions

These C programs contain the complete solution of the lab assignments I did as part of Operating Systems course at IIITDM Kancheepuram. Some of the most important C programs being,
* My own shell using `fork` and `exec` calls in linux OS.
* Solving computational problems like matrix multiplication and magic square using both multithreading using `pthreads` and multiprocessing using `fork` system calls.
* Multithreaded implementations using `semaphores`.
* Proposing and implementing the multithreading and multiprocessing algorithms of traditional *Dynamic Programming* problems like *longest common subsequence* problem and so on.
* Solutions of a few classical synchronization problems from **The Little Book of Semaphores**.
